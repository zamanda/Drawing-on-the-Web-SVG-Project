#Drawing-on-the-Web-SVG-Project
##Spring 2016, Drawing on the Web

Inspired by the festivities of the **Lunar New Year**, I made this SVG project to to commemorate the holiday. This year, is the year of the monkey, and I used the Chinese lucky colors: red, yellow and green throughout the image. Red symbolizes happiness, success, and good fortune, yellow represents power and green represents wealth. Above the monkey hang Chinese lanterns.  

Have fun forking and modifying my project!
